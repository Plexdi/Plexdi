Greetings, I'm Plexdi, also known as Thanh, a dedicated 16-year-old college student currently pursuing a BTEC Level 3 qualification in Information Technology. Alongside my academic journey, I passionately explore the realms of technology and programming.

As a part of my diverse interests, I actively engage in Twitch streaming, where I curate live content across an array of popular games, including Fortnite, Minecraft, Watch Dogs: Legion, and even the thrilling world of horror games. Off-screen, I have a penchant for savoring boba, a delightful beverage that has tickled my taste buds over the past few years. Additionally, I am an avid consumer of anime, an immersive world I delve into during my leisure hours.

In the realm of programming, I find my strength in Python, a language I've been committed to for over two years. My journey in the coding landscape is an ever-evolving one. Currently, I am diligently expanding my horizons with Typescript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, React.js, and SQL/MySQL. As a graphic designer, I also channel my creativity into crafting visually appealing designs, bringing a unique blend of aesthetics and technology to my projects.

My portfolio is a testament to the projects I've undertaken. From crafting text-based adventure games to developing Hangman and constructing a Todo list application using classes, I've demonstrated my proficiency in Python. I'm excited about my ongoing endeavor to learn and master these new technologies, further enriching my skill set and broadening my horizons.

The allure of software engineering and design beckoned to me from an early age. My inherent connection with computers, fueled by a childhood fascination with gaming and hardware exploration, set me on this path. As I ventured into computer science during my secondary education, my affinity for coding and design solidified.

In the world of technology, there's always a new challenge to embrace and an innovative solution to uncover. I eagerly look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead, and I remain committed to my journey as a technophile, a budding software engineer, and a creative graphic designer.
