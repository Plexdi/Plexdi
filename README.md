Greetings, I'm Plexdi, but you can simply refer to me as Thanh. I'm a dedicated 16-year-old college student, currently pursuing a BTEC Level 3 qualification in Information Technology. Alongside my academic journey, I passionately explore the realms of technology and programming.

As a part of my diverse interests, I actively engage in Twitch streaming, where I curate live content across an array of popular games, including Fortnite, Minecraft, Watch Dogs: Legion, and even the thrilling world of horror games. Off-screen, I have a penchant for savoring boba, a delightful beverage that has tickled my taste buds over the past few years. Additionally, I am an avid consumer of anime, an immersive world I delve into during my leisure hours.

In the realm of programming, I find my strength in Python, a language I've been committed to for over two years. My journey in the coding landscape is an ever-evolving one. Currently, I am diligently expanding my horizons with JavaScript and advancing into the captivating universe of ReactJS. I am also poised to embark on a journey of practical experience, delving into the intricacies of the IT industry.

My portfolio is a testament to the projects I've undertaken. From crafting text-based adventure games to developing Hangman, and constructing a Todo list application using classes, I've demonstrated my proficiency in Python. I'm excited about my ongoing endeavor to learn GUI development using Tkinter, a native Python module, which showcases my continuous learning and adaptation.

The allure of software engineering beckoned to me from an early age. My inherent connection with computers, fueled by a childhood fascination with gaming and hardware exploration, set me on this path. As I ventured into computer science during my secondary education, my affinity for coding solidified.

In the world of technology, there's always a new challenge to embrace and an innovative solution to uncover. I eagerly look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead, and I remain committed to my journey as a technophile and a budding software engineer.
